	                    <p>This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231</p>

                     <p>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31
2002. This version removes the copyright ownership notice such that this
license can be used with materials other than those owned by the W3C,
reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this
specific dated version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of
"use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720">previous
version</a> and is written so as to preserve the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">Free
Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility</a> and <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/W3C.php">OSI's certification</a>
under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source
Definition</a>.</p>
